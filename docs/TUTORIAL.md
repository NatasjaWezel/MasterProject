# How to use the Command Line Interface (CLI) of project: Handbag
Install python 3.8.8 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/). Scroll down and click the Windows 64-bit installer.

Install Windows terminal from the Microsoft Marketplace or click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab).

## First time: Set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies of this project
Navigate to the src folder in file explorer and open a windows terminal by right clicking the white space in the folder and choosing open Windows Terminal.
![open windows terminal](../figures/tutorial/open_terminal.png)
Create your virtual environment by typing ```python -m venv handbag-env``` and pressing enter. It might take some time.
Activate the virtual environment with: ```./handbag-env/Scripts/Activate.ps1```. While typing folder names, you can always use 'tab' to let the terminal auto-complete the filepath you're typing. When the virtual environment is activated, this should be visible. 
![activated venv](../figures/tutorial/activated_venv.png)
Install dependencies of the project: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This can take a bit of time.
You can deactivate the virtual environment with saying ```deactivate```, but you don't have to: you can always just close the terminal.

> Once you have made a virtual environment, the next time you can open the terminal in the src folder and you only have to activate the virtual environment with ```./handbag-env/Scripts/Activate.ps1```

## Testing the installation
Test if everything works with running: ```python .\quantify.py -f .\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_o.txt```. If everything worked correctly, the program should now start to run and you should be able to explore all the plots.

## Tips for using the terminal
```cd```: changes directory. Change to directory scripts by typing ```cd scripts```, and back by ```cd ../```, where ```../``` means Ã³ne folder "up", so: move to the parent directory of the folder you're currently in.</br>
```ls```: list. List all files and directories that are in the current directory. This can help you navigate through the file structure on your computer.</br>
Arrow up: using the arrow up on your keyboard you can "scroll" through the latest commands you entered, and executing them again by pressing enter.

## How the program runs
You tested the program with the command: ```python .\quantify.py -f .\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_o.txt```, but how does this command work? The flag ```-f``` specifies a file that contains the input arguments for the program.

Start with running: ```python .\quantify.py --help```. Here you can see the input arguments that the program needs. There are two required arguments: you need to specify the path to the input file with the flag `-i/--input`, and secondly you need to specify the reference point from the contact group with the `-crp/--contact_rp`. The other flags are optional and we will dive into them later.

If we look into the file `.\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_o.txt` (by opening it with any text editor you like), we see the following input:
```
--input .\testdata\H2O\H2O_XH_vdw.5_test.cor
--contact_rp O
```

#### Question 1: How would you run the program in the same way, without using the argument file?
<details>
  <summary>Answer question 1</summary>
  On the command line, type:

  ```python .\quantify.py --input .\testdata\H2O\H2O_XH_vdw.5_test.cor --contact_rp O```

  and press enter
</details>

#### Question 2: How would you run the program with using the hydrogen atom as reference point, without using the argument file?
<details>
  <summary>Answer question 2</summary>
  On the command line, type:

  ```python .\quantify.py --input .\testdata\H2O\H2O_XH_vdw.5_test.cor --contact_rp H```

  and press enter
</details>

#### Question 3: How would you run the program with the NO<sub>3</sub> R<sub>2</sub>CO file, that is also located in test data? Use the oxygen atom of the carbonyl as reference point.
<details>
  <summary>Answer question 3</summary>
  On the command line, type:

  ```python .\quantify.py --input .\testdata\NO3\NO3_R2CO_vdw.5_test.cor --contact_rp O```

  and press enter
</details>

## Making your own argument files
Implement both `.\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_h.txt` and `.\arg_files\test_no3_r2co_o.txt`.
<details>
  <summary>Implementation .\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_h.txt</summary>
  The file has to contain two lines:

  `--input .\testdata\H2O\H2O_XH_vdw.5_test.cor
  --contact_rp H`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Implementation .\arg_files\test_no3_r2co_o.txt</summary>
  The file has to contain two lines:

  `--input .\testdata\NO3\NO3_R2CO_vdw.5_test.cor 
  --contact_rp O`
</details>

## Let's take a look at the label specification
For water and nitrogen, some other pre-work was already done. Open the ```central_groups.csv```, located in the files folder (with any text editor you like - in this case excel might be a good option). First look at what atom has which label.
![labels no3 h2o rc6h5](../figures/tutorial/labels_h2o_no3_rc6h5.png)

Then look at the entries in the file. Underneath, a table is given to show the rows that the file contains. The first three atoms, center_label, y_axis_laben and xy_plane_label are the atoms that is aligned on. The first one goes on the origin (0,0,0), the second one goes on the y_axis (0,1.45,0) and the last one goes on the xy-plane (2.45, 1.56, 0). This is mostly for the visual aspect of looking at the structures later. The first structure is rotated into this position, and then is a base fragment to align all the other fragments on. For this, it is important that the three atoms have an angle with each other (they can not be on a line).

> If you have a linear group, still put an entry in all these three columns. If you have a group existing of two atoms, put one of them on the origin, and the other one in both rows. Nothing will happen, but the program needs an entry in the xy-plane column.
> The reason we ask for 3 non-linear atoms is, if you had 3 linear atoms is that you end up with a 2D overlay rather than a 3D one i.e. only 2 of the 3 orthogonal axes are defined. While you could in theory do this, it would give random positions for the contact group around the cone of the group.

| name  | center_label | y_axis_label | xy_plane_label | treat_as_R | R | bin |
| ----- | ---- |  ---- |  ---- |  ---- |  ---- |  ---- |
| H2O  | LAB1  | LAB2 | LAB3 | - | - | - |
| NO3  | LAB3  | LAB2 | LAB1 | - | - | - |

#### Question: What would you fill in for RC6H5, as shown in the picture above?

<details>
  <summary>Labels RC6H5</summary>
  In raw text format: 

  ```RC6H5,LAB2,LAB4,LAB6,-,LAB1,-```

Note: multiple answers are correct. As long as the first three atoms are not on a line, and LAB1 is in the column 'R'.
</details>

Now that you've added this line to the central_groups.csv, it is possible to run the program with this central group as well.

#### Question: How would you run the program with RC6H5, with as contact reference point the oxygen atom of CO?
<details>
  <summary>How would you </summary>
  On the command line, run:

  ```python .\quantify.py -i .\testdata\RC6H5\RC6H5_R2CO_vdw.5_test.cor -crp O```
  
  or make an argument file and run:
  
  ```python .\quantify.py -f .\arg_files\test_rc6h5_r2co_o.txt```
</details>

## And what happens when the .cor file doesn't have the right format (CENTRAL_CONTACT_blabla.cor)? 
As a final example, we'll try to run the program for the 'search6' data. Of course, you know what data it contains: you did the conquest search. It contains the data of a carbonyl and a methyl group (let's call it rcome) and an aryl group. However, you didn't give a name in the right format. (In this case, search6 is not that helpful at all to remember what search this was.)

First, add the labels to the central_groups.csv file. We want to ignore the hydrogen atoms of the methyl group. (See thesis/article for the reasoning about this.)
![labels rcome](../figures/tutorial/labels_rcome.png)

#### Question: What would you fill in in central_groups.csv for RCOMe, as shown in the picture above?
Tip: You can fill in multiple labels in a single column by separating them with a dash: '-'.
<details>
  <summary>Labels RCOMe</summary>
  In raw text format: 

  ```RCOMe,LAB1,LAB2,LAB3,-,LAB4,LAB5-LAB6-LAB7```

Note: multiple answers are correct. As long as the first three atoms are not on a line, and LAB1 is in the column 'R'.
</details>

#### Question: How would you now run this program?
You can make use of the ```--central/--contact``` input flags. Try to write an input argument file named ```.\arg_files\test_rcome_r2co_o.txt```.

<details>
  <summary>Input argument file for search6 (RCOMe_R2CO) </summary>
  The file must contain:

  ```--input .\testdata\test\search6.cor 
     --contact_rp O
     --central RCOMe
     --contact R2CO
  ```
</details>

> If the .csv containing the parameters from the conquest search has another name, you can specify that as well with using the --labels flag. So say search6.csv was called search6_labels.csv instead, the program is not able to find it automatically. You'd need to specify --labels search6_labels.csv (or rename the file).
