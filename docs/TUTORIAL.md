## First time: Set up a virtual environment and install the dependencies of this project
Navigate to the src folder in file explorer and open a windows terminal by right clicking the white space in the folder and choosing open Windows Terminal.

Create your virtual environment by typing ```python -m venv handbag-env``` and pressing enter. It might take some time.
Activate the virtual environment with: ```./handbag-env/Scripts/Activate.ps1```. While typing folder names, you can always use 'tab' to let the terminal auto-complete the filepath you're typing. When the virtual environment is activated, this should be visible.

Install dependencies of the project: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```. This can take a bit of time.
You can deactivate the virtual environment with saying ```deactivate```, but you don't have to: you can always just close the terminal.

## After the first time:
Open the terminal in the src folder and activate the virtual environment with ```./handbag-env/Scripts/Activate.ps1```

## Testing the installation
Test if everything works with running: ```python .\quantify.py -f .\arg_files\test_h2o_xh_o.txt```. If everything worked correctly, the program should now start to run and you should be able to explore all the plots.

## Tips for using the terminal
```cd```: changes directory. Change to directory scripts by typing ```cd scripts```, and back by ```cd ../```, where ```../``` means Ã³ne folder "up", so: move to the parent directory of the folder you're currently in.
```ls```: list. List all files and directories that are in the current directory. This can help you navigate through the file structure on your computer.
