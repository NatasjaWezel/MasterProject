# This file contains information on how to build a methyl model.
# The dihedral has to be specified, and the place of the first H
# If you do not specify how to build the methyl model here, but d√≥ bin the atoms in the alignment,
# your central group will not have a methyl group. If you chose to ignore the hydrogen atoms instead
# in the alignment, the methyl group will be averaged.
# 
# The columns are defined as follows:
# central: the name of the central group
# dihedral1: first atom of the dihedral
# dihedral2: second atom of the dihedral
# dihedral3: third atom of the dihedral, the hydrogens will be attached to this atom
# angle: the average angle of dihedral2-dihedral3-hydrogen
# distance: the average distance of dihedral3-hydrogen
# first_deg: 0 or 60, is the first atom in a plane with dihedral1 (0) or not (60)
