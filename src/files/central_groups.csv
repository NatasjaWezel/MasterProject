# This file contains information about the central groups that are feeded into the program.
# Make sure to fill in each column, separating multiple labels with a dash '-'.
# If you don't remember the labels that your molecule has, try plotting fragment 0 with labels.
#
# The columns are defined as follows:
# name: the name of the central group
# center_label: the label of the atom that needs to be put on the origin
# y_axis_label, xy_plane_label: the labels of the atoms that need to be on the y axis and in the xy plane.
# R: the label(s) of the atom(s) that can be multiple atoms
# treat_as_R: the label(s) of the atom(s) that you would want to treat as R (so treat them differently in the volume
# calculation, etc.)
# bin: the label(s) of the atom(s) that you want to throw away before
